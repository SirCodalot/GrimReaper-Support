# Use '&' for color codes
# The available placeholder keys for every message are listed on top of it
# You can use placeholders by typing "%" + key (Examples: %player, %hearts)
#
# There are three types of messages:
# Chat - A normal message that will appear in chat
# Title - A text that will be displayed in the middle of the player's screen. Titles can have up to two lines
# Hologram - A text that will be displayed somewhere in the world and will always face the player. Very similar to floating player nametags.
